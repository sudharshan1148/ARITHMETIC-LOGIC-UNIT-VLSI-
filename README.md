**In Task 1 of this project, I completed the design and implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). An ALU is a key component in any digital processing system and is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. This task involved the use of Verilog programming and simulation techniques to create, verify, and validate the design.

To begin with, I first studied the functional requirements of a basic ALU. These include arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, and logical operations like AND, OR, and XOR. The ALU may also perform shift operations or comparison tasks. Once I understood these core functions, I began to plan out how to implement them using Verilog, a hardware description language used for designing digital circuits.

The Verilog program was written by dividing the ALU into manageable modules. Each module corresponded to a specific operation. I used case statements to differentiate between operations based on control inputs. The inputs and outputs were defined using input and output keywords in Verilog. I also used always blocks triggered by changes in input to perform the required logic or arithmetic calculations.

After the coding was completed, I moved on to simulate the design. Simulation is an essential step in hardware design because it allows you to verify functionality without needing to build the actual hardware. For this purpose, I created a Verilog testbench. The testbench applied a variety of input combinations to the ALU and monitored the output to verify that it matched the expected results. Through this, I was able to identify and fix any bugs in the design.

The simulation helped ensure that each operation worked correctly for different input scenarios. For example, the testbench verified how the ALU performed addition and subtraction across a range of values, including edge cases such as overflow or zero results. This process of simulation made the design more reliable and efficient.

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in writing and debugging Verilog code. I also became more familiar with the use of simulation tools and how to interpret waveform outputs. Understanding how to read simulation timing diagrams and debug logic errors was an important skill developed during this task.

In summary, Task 1 was focused on the ALU design using Verilog and simulation. I successfully implemented the required operations, verified them through simulation, and ensured correct functionality. This task strengthened my understanding of digital system design and helped build a foundation in hardware description languages. The experience also highlighted the importance of structured coding, modular design, and thorough testing in digital electronics. I now feel more confident in my ability to design and test digital circuits using Verilog.
